# Late 90s

- Enthusiasm dies down and VR vanishes from the consumer market
- No content
- Hardware is underpowered to produce compeling enough experiences
- High End PC is a Pentium 100 Mhz.

---

# Since late 90s

- Virtuous cycle of 3D Hardware development driven by the game industry

- We get extremely fast GPUs

# Today

- We can build affordable head mounted displays.

- 3D hardware is powerful enough to create compelling VR content.

# Today

- We can build affordable head mounted displays.

- 3D hardware is powerful enough to create compelling VR content.

---

# Today

- No market
- No users
- No content
- No consumer products released.
- Lots of announcements and release dates and much more in stealth mode.

---

- Six Sense STEM (July 2014, delayed)
- Leap Motion (released)
- Myo Band (Late 2014)
- Virtuix Omni (Jan 2014, delayed)

---

# Content designed for VR

- EVE: Valkyrie
- Superhot
- Gallery, six element
- Alien: Isolation
- Technolust
- Luckeys Tale

---

# What's the big deal about VR?

- Presence

- The sense that you are somewhere else

- More than immersion

- Other media approximate experiences. VR is the experience itself

---

# What's the big deal about VR?

- It's a superset

- It's bigger than all the existing media

- VR can simulate any other medium
- It's bigger than reality itself becasue we can recreate experiences that are impossible in the physical world

- It's the definitive medium

---

# VR will evolve into a major platform

- The race to establish the VR platform has begun

- Cold War

- A guessing game where contenders try to anticipate each other's moves

---

# Internet will be VR
# VR will be the Internet
# It has to remain free

class: center, middle

# VR is too important to be left to one or two companies

---

# The VR Web

- The Metaverse

- Concept coined by Neal Stephenson in the Snow Crash novel. It describes his idea of the Internet of the future (future from 1992)

---

# The VR Web

- Metaverse

- "A virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users"

- "Collective virtual shared space"

- "Persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe"

---

# The VR Web

- The Web we know today ticks all the boxes

- "The Web is the Metaverse – just with a 2D interface" Vlad Vukićević, co creator of WebGL

- At Mozilla we believe that the Metaverse will speak JavaScript

---

# Are we VR yet?

- The Web is 3D ready

- CSS 3D Transformations

- WebGL. After Apple's announcement in WWDC 2014 it's now available in all major browsers.

---

# Where do I start with VR?

- The only HMD available is the Oculus Rift (DK1 and DK2)

- Unreal Engine and Unity hold the tooling duopoly. Paywalls

- Gamepad as input device

---

# The Browser as your VR playground

- We have a gamepad API

- We have a fullscreen API

- And now we also have experimental builds of Chrome and Firefox with Rift support

---

# The VR enabled browser

- You can query for connected VR Devices

```javascript
navigator.getVRDevices().then(gotVRDevices);

function gotVRDevices(vrDevices) {
  // First, find a HMD -- just use the first one we find
  for (var i = 0; i < vrdevs.length; ++i) {
    if (vrdevs[i] instanceof HMDVRDevice) {
      vrHMD = vrdevs[i];
      break;
    }
  }

  // Then, find that HMD's position sensor
  for (var i = 0; i < vrdevs.length; ++i) {
    if (vrdevs[i] instanceof PositionSensorVRDevice &&
        vrdevs[i].hardwareUnitId == vrHMD.hardwareUnitId)
    {
      vrSensor = vrdevs[i];
      break;
    }
  }

}```

---

# The VR enabled browser

- Push canvas content to the HMD retrieved by getVRDevices

- Distortion is taken care by the browser

```javascript
  canvas.mozRequestFullScreen( { vrDisplay: vrHMD } );
```

---

# The VR enabled browser

- Read state from the sensor retrieved by getVRDevices

- Head orientation to update content accordingly

```javascript
  var orientation = vrInput.getState().orientation;
```

---

# The VR enabled browser

- Easier with Three.js
- VREffect and VRControls

```javascript
  var viewportRatio = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    70, viewportRatio, 1, 10000 );
  var scene = new THREE.Scene();

  // Construct your scene

  var vrEffect = new THREE.VREffect(renderer, onVREffectLoaded);
  var vrControls = new THREE.VRControls(camera);

  render();

  function render() {
    // Update the scene
    vrControls.update();
    vrEffect.render(scene, camera);
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
  }

```

---

# The VR enabled browser

- DOM in VR
- CSS 3D Transforms

```javascript
  Example
```

---

# The future of the VR Web

- The Web is cross platform. Support to other HMDs as soon as they become available

- Support of input devices besides gamepad

---

# The future of the VR Web

- Many people think that the declarative nature is a fundamental ingredient of the Web
- VRML, anyone?
- GLAM is a project that modernizes the original VRML approach
- Mathbox 2, Data Driven Geometry
